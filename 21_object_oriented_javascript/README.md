# Object-Oriented JS

## Objectives
* Create objects as object literals or by instantiating them using new Object
* Add properties to store values (both primitive and non-primitive) on objects
* Write functions that use this and assign them as properties on objects
* Identify the differences between bind, call, and apply
* Use arrow functions to automatically bind context
* Create a class using both ES5 and ES6 syntaxes. In both syntaxes, students should be able to:
* Write a constructor
* Instantiate a new object
* Create private "class" variables using the ES6 class syntax, closures, and IIFEs
* Write instance methods for JS classes
* Write class methods for JS classes (e.g. filters and search functions)
