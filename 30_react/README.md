# Intro to React

## Objectives

- Understand build tools and show how webpack works
- Use historical context and the Mod 3 experience to explain why React and declarative programming is special
- Start to understand the Virtual DOM
- See what a React Component actually is (an object, made by a class or function)
- Build custom components and see initial JSX

## Steps

- Discuss Vanilla JS
- Brief History/Context
- Project Set Up
- Briefly on Virtual DOM
- my create element
- JSX

## What was hard about creating vanilla JavaScript apps?

- Keeping track of lots of parts [React + Webpack]
- Rerendering certain things (sometimes append, sometimes backend is diff) [React / Rendering on props and state change]
- Having to repeat the setup every time we make a new app [React + Build system]
- Coming up with your own system of organization for index esp. w/ lots of interconnected functions [React + Build system]
- Loading in multiple JavaScript files [React + Build system]
- Keeping track of all the backticks, quotes, parentheses, curly braces, semicolons [No quotes around html and interpolation is much easier]
- Promises and callbacks (callback hell)
- Adding (same) event listeners to multiple elements
- Keeping track of nested elements [No direct DOM manipulation]
